/**
	[InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/products/) is an open source time-series database.
	It supports high write loads, large data set storage, and conserves space through downsampling, automatically expiring and deleting
	unwanted data as well as backup and restore. InfluxDB also makes it easy to analyze data by providing an easy-to-use SQL-like query language.

    This library implements a convenience wrapper API for influx.
